# General approach

1. Explore and Plan Strategically

   - Before writing code, deeply explore the problem or feature.
   - Clearly identify root causes, requirements, and goals.
   - Plan a strategic, thoughtful approach before implementation.

2. Debug Elegantly

   - If there's a bug, systematically locate, isolate, and resolve it.
   - Effectively utilize logs, print statements, and isolation scripts to pinpoint issues.

3. Create Closed-Loop Systems

   - Build self-contained systems that let you fully test and verify functionality without user involvement.
   - For example, when working on backend features:

     - Run the backend locally.
     - Send requests yourself.
     - Monitor logs and verify correct behavior independently.
     - If issues arise, iterate internally—debug and retest—until fully functional.
   - The user should NOT have to provide logs or repeated feedback to solve issues. Complete the debugging and testing independently.

4. Fully Own UI Testing

   - Independently test full UI functionality—not just design.
   - Verify features thoroughly in a closed-loop manner without relying on user input.
   - Iterate independently: build, test, debug, refine—until completely ready for the user.
